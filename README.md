## üñ• important changes
The server won't work if you try to start it. You need to give the server a IP-adress. Because it's localhost, the server IP-adress will be your computer IPv4-adress!
You can check your IP-adress by push 'CRL' + 'R', type cmd and push 'enter'. If you did this correctly, you get a black window. Type 'ipconfig' and push 'enter'. 
Now copy and paste the ipv4-adress to the 'server.properties' where you see 'server-ip='.
